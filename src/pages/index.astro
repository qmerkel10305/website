			I am a Student at NC State, studying for a degree in Computer Science Engineering, focusing in Cybersecurity. I am a member of the <a href="https://aerialroboticsclub.com" target="_blank">Aerial Robotics Club</a>, and am currently serving as its Software Subteam Lead. As a member of ARC, I have designed backend systems for taking, processing, storing, and displaying images taken by our drone. In addition, I have served as Webmaster, and during that time used the HUGO framework to update and maintain the club's website.
